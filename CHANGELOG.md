# Changelog – DeepSeek Credit Checker

## v1.4.0 (2026-06-10)

### ✨ New Features

* **🎨 Balance in tray icon** – the tray icon now renders the current balance as text with a status color: green (OK), orange (≤ 2× threshold), red (below threshold), blue with "$" (unknown). Values under $10 show one decimal (e.g. "1.5"), $100+ shows "99+".
* **🚀 Start with Windows** – new checkbox in Settings registers the app in the `HKCU\...\Run` registry key. The registry is the single source of truth – the checkbox always reflects the actual state.
* **🔑 Test API key button** – validate the API key directly in Settings without waiting for the next poll. Shows balance on success, distinguishes invalid key (401) from network errors.
* **💚 Recharge detection** – when the balance jumps up between polls, a positive toast appears: "Credit recharged (+$X) — currently $Y".
* **🔒 Single instance** – a second launch of the app exits silently (named mutex), preventing duplicate polling and tray icons.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **🧩 TrayIconFormatter** – new pure logic class in Core (status + icon text) separated from GDI rendering for unit testability.
* **🧩 StartupService (IStartupService)** – registry-based autostart management with error logging.
* **🧩 PollingService** – new `RechargeDetected` event (`RechargeEventArgs`: Amount, NewBalance); `PollResult` now carries `Threshold` for icon coloring.
* **🧩 Icon lifecycle** – dynamically generated 32×32 icons properly destroy the unmanaged HICON (`DestroyIcon`) and dispose the previous icon on swap – no GDI handle leaks.
* **🧪 70 tests** – 16 new (TrayIconFormatter status/text matrix, recharge detection incl. first-poll and noise-delta edge cases, threshold propagation).

## v1.3.0 (2026-06-10)

### 🔧 Spend Calculation Fixes

* **🐛 DateTime Kind mismatch fixed** – SQLite timestamps ("Unspecified") now auto-convert to UTC so `ToLocalTime()` works consistently. Eliminates incorrect assignment of records to calendar days.
* **📊 Today's spend fixed** – calculated as `SumPositiveDeltas` for today's local calendar day. Correctly ignores top-ups within the day.
* **📈 Weekly/monthly stats fixed** – per-day aggregation (SumPositiveDeltas per calendar day) instead of a flat sum over the period. Eliminates distortion from cross-midnight deltas and timestamp jitter.
* **🎯 Prediction refined** – average daily spend is computed only from complete calendar days (≥12h data span). Partial days (e.g. Jun 07 with only 5h of data) are excluded. Range (~N-M days) is only shown when 3+ full days are available.

### ✨ New Features

* **📥 CSV Export** – a "📥 Export CSV" button in the Data Browser window to export balance history to a semicolon-delimited CSV file.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **🧩 BalanceSnapshot** – `Timestamp` setter now normalizes `DateTimeKind.Unspecified` to `DateTimeKind.Utc`.
* **🧩 PredictionEngine** – `AggregateDailySpend` uses local date filtering, 12h threshold for full-day eligibility, and `SumPositiveDeltas` per day.
* **🧩 DashboardViewModel** – new `SumSpendByDay` helper for correct per-day aggregation in weekly/monthly stats.
* **🧪 54 tests** – 2 new prediction tests (real-world data + range for 3+ full days).

## v1.2.0 (2026-06-09)

### ✨ Core Features

* **🔄 Automatic updates via GitHub Releases** – the app now checks for new versions on startup and periodically every 4 hours; when a newer release is found, a notification toast appears with a download button, and the tray context menu shows the available version
* **📥 One-click install** – clicking "Download" streams the release ZIP, extracts it, replaces all application files via a batch script, and automatically restarts with the new version
* **🟢 Update banner in Dashboard** – when an update is available, the Dashboard shows a green banner with the version number and a download button
* **🔹 Version info in Settings** – the bottom of the Settings window now shows the current application version (e.g. `🔹 v1.2.0`)

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **♻️ GitHub Actions release workflow** – manual `workflow_dispatch` trigger builds, tests, publishes, zips, and creates a GitHub Release with tag automatically; no push/PR automation keeps releases fully manual
* **🧩 IUpdateService / UpdateService** – new service in Core checking `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest` (no token needed), streaming ZIP downloads with progress, batch script generation, and success-marker file for post-update confirmation toast
* **🪝 UpdateAvailable event** – DashboardViewModel subscribes reactively; the update banner appears even if the dashboard was opened before the first check completed

## v1.1.0 (2026-06-09)

### ✨ Core Features

* **📊 Today's spend** – added tracking of credit spent during the current day (calculated as the sum of positive balance deltas); displayed in the tray tooltip, tray context menu, and dashboard statistics row
* **📈 Improved spend calculation** – weekly, monthly, and daily spend statistics now correctly handle credit top-ups by summing consecutive balance deltas instead of taking a simple first-last snapshot difference, preventing under-reporting when credit is recharged

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **🧮 SpendCalculator** – introduced a reusable, fully tested `SumPositiveDeltas()` utility to centralize and fix balance logic across all tracking features
